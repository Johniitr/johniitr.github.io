John Mohd Wani is an early career researcher focused on cryosphere, particularly snow and permafrost processes. This website hosts my work, blog, and updates. I apply and develop physically-based models **[GEOtop](https://github.com/geotopmodel/geotop)**, **[GEOframe](https://github.com/geoframecomponents)** to bridge the gap between field observations and theoretical understanding, aiming to reduce uncertainty in water resource predictions for high-altitude regions.
