  abstract  = "This paper presents a long-term snow water equivalent dataset in
               the Po River District, Italy, spanning from 1991 to 2021 at daily
               time step and 500 m spatial resolution partially covering the
               mountain ranges of Alps and Apennines. The data has been
               generated using a hybrid modelling approach integrating the
               hydrological modelling conducted with the physically-based GEOtop
               model, preprocessing of the meteorological data, and assimilation
               of in-situ snow measurements and Earth Observation snow products
               to enhance the quality of the model estimates. A rigorous quality
               assessment of the dataset has been performed at different control
               points selected based on reliability, quality, and territorial
               distribution. The point validation between simulated and observed
               snow depth across control points shows the accuracy of the
               dataset in simulating the normal and relatively high snow
               conditions, respectively. Additionally, satellite snow cover maps
               have been compared with simulated snow depth maps, as a function
               of elevation and aspect. 2D Validation shows accurate values over
               time and space, expressed in terms of snowline along the cardinal
               directions.",
