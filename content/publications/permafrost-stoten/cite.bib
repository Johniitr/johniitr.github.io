  abstract = "Cold-arid regions of the trans-Himalaya in the Indian Himalayan
              Region (IHR) is suspected to have a significant area of
              permafrost. However, information on the ground thermal regime of
              these permafrost areas is so far not available. This study bridge
              this knowledge gap by analysing the sub-surface thermal regime of
              selected sites in the Ganglass catchment, Ladakh range. Near
              surface ground temperature data recorded during September 2016 to
              August 2017 using 24-miniature temperature data loggers
              distributed across 12 plots and covering an elevation range of
              4700-5612 m a.s.l. are used in this study. Permafrost
              characteristics including plausible ranges of thermal offset,
              active-layer thickness and mean annual ground temperature at 10 m
              depth were estimated by driving a one-dimensional heat conduction
              model. Two statistical models were used to map first order
              estimates of permafrost area in this 15.4 km2 catchment. Study
              suggest permafrost occurrence at all sites above 4900 m a.s.l.
              with active-layer thickness ranging from 0.1 to 4.2 m and the mean
              annual ground surface temperature ranging from between -10.0 and
              -0.85 °C for these sites. MAAT at these sites range from -4.1 to
              -8.9 °C and the surface offsets vary from -1.1 to 3.9 °C.
              Estimated thermal offset range from -0.9 to 0 °C. Both statistical
              models show comparable results and suggest 95\% mean permafrost
              cover in the catchment above 4727 m a.s.l. These results strongly
              indicate existence of significant permafrost areas across the high
              elevations of the cold-arid regions of IHR. So far, permafrost
              processes are not considered for assessing present and future
              estimates of water and regional climate and as a causative factor
              for disasters like debris flows and landslides in the region. This
              study highlight the need for greater research efforts on Himalayan
              permafrost to have a comprehensive understanding of Himalayan
              cryosphere.",
