  abstract  = "A catastrophic debris flow in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga
               rivers in Uttarakhand, India, on 7 February 2021 left a trail of
               disaster. Around 100–150 people lost their lives according to
               Uttarakhand Chief Secretary statement given to ANI news portal,
               two hydropower projects were badly damaged and a bridge across
               the Rishiganga River was washed off in the event. Study shows
               that the debris flow is caused due to detachment of 0.59 km2
               right lobe of a hanging glacier and resultant ice-rock avalanche.
               This right lobe of the glacier was located over a mountain slope
               having an average slope of 35° at 4700–5555 m a.s.l. and
               travelled 12.4 km before hitting the infrastructure projects.
               Role of precipitation, snow cover, land surface temperature, and
               permafrost processes were investigated for identifying causes of
               the event. Since 2012, monsoon precipitation and mean annual land
               surface temperature (LST) showed significant increasing trend.
               Snow cover during monsoon months showed increasing trend and
               September, October and November experienced decreasing trend at
               glacier elevations. Mean annual LST increased from − 0.3 °C in
               2012 to a peak of 0.4 °C in 2016. Central lobe of the glacier
               advanced during this period and eventually fell off in 2016
               suggesting that the LST warming forced reduction of frictional
               drag at the interface facilitating it advancement and eventual
               dislodgement. Permafrost modelling suggests warm permafrost below
               50 m and conditions favourable for intense frost cracking up to
               10–15 m. At ~ 40 m depth, the delayed response of 2012–2016
               warming produced peak positive temperature conditions by December
               and probably facilitated the formation of thin film of water at
               the deeper layers acting as a lubricant for glacier sliding. It
               is also suggested that the increase in summer precipitation might
               have forced thickening of the accumulation area and thereby
               increasing the shear stress for sliding of the glacier. It is
               proposed that the recent change in the weather conditions in the
               region is primarily responsible for this event through
               geological, glaciological, and permafrost processes. Flood
               modelling study suggests a flood volume of ~ 10 MCM generating
               24.5 m flow depth at the bridge site with 12.7 m/s flow velocity.
               The event highlighted the need for improved monitoring of the
               cryosphere areas of the Himalaya to capture the early warning
               signs for better preparedness.",
