Seasonal snowpack is a key component of the mountain cryosphere, acting as a **vital natural reservoir** that regulates runoff downstream in snowfed basins. In mid- and low-elevation mountain regions such as the European Alps, snow processes such as accumulation and ablation are **highly sensitive to climate change**, having direct implications for hydrological forecasting and water availability.

## Analyzing Three Decades of SWE Changes

This study provides the first comprehensive **long-term (1991–2021) analysis** of **Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)** changes in the Po River District, Italy, one of Europe’s most climate-sensitive regions. Our findings show **stark elevation-dependent changes** in snow water storage and duration with profound and immediate implications for water security and climate adaptation.

Using a high-resolution (500m, daily) dataset from 1991–2021 **[Dall'Amico et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04633-5)**, first we observed a profound **loss of snow volume and decrease in duration below 2000 meters**, with some low-elevation bands losing over **30%** of their total snow-water storage. In contrast, high-elevation zones (>2500 m) are experiencing increased accumulation but a continued shortened snow season. Second, we show that this shorter snow season is not just an artifact of earlier spring melt, but is primarily driven by a **delayed onset of snow accumulation in early winter**.

*(Note: High-elevation zones (>2500 m) are experiencing increased accumulation, but this requires careful interpretation due to methodological constraints and systematic overestimation of high elevation precipitation by ERA5.)*

## Implications for the Po River Basin

These elevation-dependent changes highlight a fundamental shift in the hydrological regime of the Po River Basin. The loss of seasonal snowpack has **significant implications for the timing and volume of runoff** and the future availability of water in the region. The Po River Basin is moving from a stable hydrological system to a more **volatile system**.
