Are you interested in **Cryospheric Science**, **Hydrological Modelling**, and **High-Performance Computing**?

We are looking for a highly motivated Master’s student (University of Trento) to join a cutting-edge research project focused on snowpack dynamics across the Nordic Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.

## Project Title
**A Multi-Modal Comparison of Snow Dynamics (SWE & Sublimation) in the Nordic Region**

## The Science
Snow is a critical component of the hydrological cycle in high latitudes. However, quantifying how much snow is on the ground (**Snow Water Equivalent - SWE**) and how much evaporates directly into the atmosphere (**Sublimation**) remains a challenge for numerical models.

In this work, you will evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art physics-based models across the diverse landscapes of Finland, Sweden, and Norway:
1.  **SnowPack**
2.  **GEOtop**
3.  **SNOWModel**

## Methodology
You will employ a dual-scale approach:

1.  **Spatial Simulation:** You will run spatially continuous simulations across the entire Nordic region using ERA5 reanalysis data. You will implement a "Virtual Point" methodology to run these models grid-wise on **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** clusters.
2.  **Point Validation:** You will validate model performance against in-situ data from **ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System)** and other available sites, representing key ecosystems like Arctic, boreal forests, and peatlands environments.

## Supervision
You will work in an international research environment.

* **Supervisor:** John Mohd Wani (University of Trento)
* **Co-Supervisor:** **[Dr. Shaakir Shabir Dar](https://www.oulu.fi/en/researchers/shaakir-shabir-dar)** (Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Oulu, Finland). Dr. Dar brings world-class expertise in snow hydrology and modelling.

## What We Are Looking For
* **Background:** Civil/Environmental Engineering, Earth Sciences, Hydrology, or relevant fields.
* **Interests:** Numerical modelling and cold-region hydrology.
* **Essential Skills:** Experience with **Python** (for scripting model runs and data analysis).
* **Bonus Skills:** Knowledge of GIS and Linux/Unix environments.

## Why Apply?
* **International Experience:** Possibility of a paid research stay in Oulu, Finland.
* **Skill Development:** Master advanced hydrological models and big data analysis.
* **Impact:** Contribute to research that helps us understand water resources in a changing climate.
