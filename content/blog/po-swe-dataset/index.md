We are pleased to announce the publication of a comprehensive new snow water equivalent dataset: **"30-years (1991-2021) Snow Water Equivalent Dataset in the Po River District, Italy"**, now published in **[Scientific Data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04633-5)**.

This dataset addresses a critical need for high-resolution, long-term snow water equivalent data in one of Europe's most productive and climate-sensitive regions.

The Po River District covers a vast and complex topography, including parts of the Alps and Apennines. Understanding historical snow dynamics here is crucial for water management.

* **Time Span:** 1991 – 2021 (30 Years)
* **Resolution:** 500 m (Spatial) / Daily (Temporal)
* **Coverage:** Po River District (Alps & Apennines)

Generating consistent data over complex terrain requires more than just interpolation. This dataset was generated by the **[Waterjade SRL team](https://waterjade.com)** in a collaborative effort between **[Autorità di Bacino Distrettuale del Fiume Po](https://www.adbpo.it)** and **[University of Trento](https://www.centro3a.unitn.it)** using a **hybrid modeling approach** that integrates:

1.  **Physically-based Modeling:** Using the **[GEOtop model](https://github.com/geotopmodel/geotop)** to simulate the snow dynamics.
2.  **Data Assimilation:** Enhancing model estimates by assimilating in-situ snow depth measurements and Earth Observation (satellite) snow products.

This combination allows to fill observational gaps while maintaining physical consistency in the snowpack simulation.

## Why This Dataset is Unique?

We believe that this dataset fills a critical gap in the scientific understanding of hydrology in the region. It represents an unprecedented piece of information for four key reasons:

1.  **Longest Time Series:** It reports the longest time series of coherent SWE maps at daily aggregation in Italy (surpassing existing datasets which typically cover shorter periods).
2.  **Homogeneity:** The maps are homogeneous in terms of modeling approach across the full 30 years and the whole domain, which significantly facilitates the interpretation of long-term trends.
3.  **Drought Monitoring:** The maps can be used to calculate the **SWE anomaly** of a given position relative to the 1991–2021 statistical distribution. This is a vital tool for addressing snow drought alerts.
4.  **Benchmarking:** It could be used as a high-quality benchmark to validate temperature-index models and other simple models frequently used for operational purposes.
