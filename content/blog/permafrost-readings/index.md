**Permafrost** is defined as sub-surface material, excluding glaciers, having a temperature of less or equal to 0 °C for at least two consecutive years (ACGR, 1988, Van Everdingen, 2005).

Understanding permafrost dynamics is essential for predicting the future of high-latitude and high-altitude regions. However, for those new to the subject, finding the right entry point in the literature can be difficult.

In this post, I share my personal collection of foundational readings for beginners. These papers cover the essential definitions, the governing thermal physics, and the basics of permafrost modeling. Think of this as your essential reading list to build a strong theoretical framework before diving into complex modeling or fieldwork.

Additionally, you can find well-documented information on the long-term state and changes of mountain permafrost in the Swiss Alps through the **[Swiss Permafrost Monitoring Network](https://www.permos.ch)** (PERMOS). Also, they have documented and compiled **[best practice recommendations](https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.607875)** for the long-term measurement of permafrost temperatures.

Finally the permafrost **[Glossary](https://www.permafrost.org/publication/glossary-of-permafrost-and-related-ground-ice-terms/)** (old) that will give you the definitions of the permafrost related terms.

Don't forget to keep an eye on the **[International Permafrost Association](https://www.permafrost.org/)** (IPA) website for events and other stuff related to permafrost. Also subscribe to the **[Permafrost Young Researcher's Network](https://pyrn.arcticportal.org/)** (PYRN), that promotes the future generation of permafrost researchers under the patronage of IPA.
